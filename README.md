# hello-world
I don't have New Year's Resolutions. 
Building good habits are not resolutions. 
It is more about being attentive of the time used on particular tasks. 
Learning to code is my master goal for this year.
Using GitHub is part of the process.
The reason behind this master goal can be stated as follows:
I want to learn to learn. Getting myself better organized and accountable.
It is not about changing my career's path. If that would be the outcome... Well, I won't say no.
I also want to pass over my fears of using digital technologies. 
Second draft of this first entry.
